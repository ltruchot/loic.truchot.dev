years of marriage with JavaScript. Not easy every day of course, but I don't regret anything.\nSince January 2019, I have been working as a freelance: fullstack JS half-teacher / half-senior in different companies and schools (mainly partena, itenium, lucidweb and interface3).\nBefore that, I had a lead-dev position at Adneom (architecture, estimates, technical validation, devops, agility, boarding and developments), and I led the JS community: training, technical watch groups, meetups, hackatons...\nIn a world that changes so quickly, where IT is everywhere, I hope everyone can learn Computer Science and earn a good salary by using it on interesting projects.\nThis site presents my different activities in the IT field. It is primarily intended for my students as a teacher, and for employers who wish to discover my profile.\n","id":"https://loic.truchot.dev/","title":"Bio"},"https://loic.truchot.dev/blog/":{"body":"Blog\n","id":"https://loic.truchot.dev/blog/","title":"Blog"},"https://loic.truchot.dev/blog/cure-impostor-syndrome-with-functional-programming/":{"body":"Ten years of web development made me feel like Neo, before he met Morpheus. Something was wrong in this world. I had some clues, but I couldn't explain exactly what it was.\nMy everyday language was JavaScript. I eventually decided to become a teacher and explain how to make real-world webapps to beginners and juniors.\nI didn't switch careers because I felt established, in fact, it was the opposite. I wanted to be a teacher so I could upgrade my skills, question them, and cure my own impostor syndrome.\nWho, after a degree and ten years of practice in a field, can feel like an impostor; an eternal newbie? Programmers, of course.\nBut why? I'll try to explain what I discovered.\nI used to start my programming lessons with something like: \"You don't need maths at all to be a good programmer. We need problem solvers.\"\nAnd of course: \"There is a tool for everything. You don't even need to be a good coder if you know where to find, and use, the right resources.\"\nAnd even: \"As the industry is changing so fast, you have to learn a framework per year to keep up with the trends.\"\nWhen we speak about quality, I always promote wisely-chosen camelCase variable names. When someone asks me why the web is so messy, I describe JavaScript's weaknesses and fatigue (JS, a language that nobody learns), coders' laziness, lack of tests/DevOps/design patterns/quality tools, etc.\nWhen it comes to impostor syndrome, even if I suffer from it, I just try to reassure people to: \"Continue to deliver apps, it's in your head, it will vanish with your achievements.\"\nYet, my impostor syndrome didn't vanish in time - my achievements did.\nThe entirety of my websites and apps disappeared. My first PHP &amp; ASP.NET custom CMS, my Java &amp; early Node back ends, my jQuery plugins, my Dojo apps, my Ruby on Rails projects, my AngularJS landing pages and Ionic mobile apps, even my recent work with Vue 1, Angular 2 beta and early React are not online anymore.\nAnd I know why. Those projects were too big to change and too buggy - the technology was perishable, investment flow was inconsistent, and the new coders were too inexperienced to grow the existing codebase.\nEven the work done with the best practices are lost, dead and burning in (callback) hell. DDD, design patterns, API, microservices, TDD, linters + prettiers, comments, GitFlow, best frameworks and libraries, Docker, CI/CD and DevOps, KISS, Redux, ReactiveX, Agile management, task runners and transpilers, pair programming and reviews, etc.\nWe tried everything. But after all of that, something in the projects is still bad. The codebases will continue to be updated until it's too big; then we want to re-code it from scratch. It's obviously a vicious circle.\nWhat if I was wrong all this time? Ten years of errors?\nWhat if there is a different explanation for the mess we made in web development, and in computer science in general?\nWhat if the thing we missed was in fact the exact opposite of what I was teaching?\nIf so let's reverse the instructions.\n\nStop trying to solve the problem as enthusiastic monkey patchers.\nStop combining unreliable tools without knowing the basics.\nStop placing every code in cages, terrorized by the monsters we know we will create.\nStop filling the endless void with more code.\nStop choosing names or developing static APIs bound to versatile problems, with perishable purpose.\nStop developing new data structures, without expressing the potential of existing ones.\nStop changing technology, frameworks and code base every month - modify them in a way that they'll be more reliable and usable in 10 years time.\nStop being an impostor.\n\nFunctional Programming\nHave you heard about functional programming?\nYes of course, because every big language, company, and thought leader has taken steps in this direction for a few years now.\nBut what is Functional Programming about?\nTwo years ago, I went to my nearest university library, trying to find books about monads, Lambda calculus, semigroups, combinators, linear algebra, higher-order functions, and others subjects that pops when we discover FP.\nI was naively searching for computer science books and found nothing.\nA few weeks ago, I went to the same place for a book about Boolean algebra, to prepare for class.\nThe library assistant took me to the mathematics shelves, and there I discovered the Grail - 50 old books about everything you can find in the fantasy-land of Functional Programming.\nMonoïds, and the operations you can do with them, were clearly explained in the first dusty book I opened.\nIt was a moment of enlightenment, the Morpheus pill was this shelf. The answer I was searching since 10 years was incredibly simple: \"math matters\". I still don't understand everything about Monoïds, but I can clearly see the path now, with the green characters of the matrix falling all around me.\nWhy don't programs work?\nWhy do we need to completely rewrite them every two years?\nBecause they lack mathematics. Of course.\nWe want to manipulate the \"zero\" and the \"one\" all day, but we don't even know about simple (Boolean) algebra like identity, commutativity, associability, idempotency, etc.\nProblem solving is not the skill - spending your time reinventing and patching (even smartly) will still increase the codebase, creating a form of \"technical debt\" that nobody wants to pay.\nSo what do we need?\nWhat we need is less code.\nWhat we need is proof that it works. Not \"TDD proof\" that is costly, but an approach that will surely solve every case.\nWhat we need is a scalability level that doesn't require any name for variables other than a, b, or c. Our functions will be so simple, so generic, so stable, so composable, so future-proof that they can be read and use the same way now and in 30 years.\nWhat we need isn't artificial limits and tools everywhere to avoid bad code or bad practices, but algebra everywhere.\nWhat we need is to stop being impostors, and eventually begin to think for the computer, think like it. This machine we are programming, this concept of being able to cleverly calculate everything. It will be hard. At least it's tough for me.\nWhat does a computer do when it's powered up?\nIt takes data from DD as input, and computes it as outputs that our devices need. Then, it waits for new inputs, allowing us to develop programs or apps to map certain outputs again.\nThere are only two cases:\n\nIf it's already computed then we just need memory.\nIf it will be computed we need a function.\n\nWhy did we take something so simple and complicate it? Instead of learning math, we chose to invent a cryptic world of pop-cultured languages and tools that can more or less solve any kind of problem.\nEvery time we try to play it by ear we create more problems.\nIt's bug oriented programming.\nIn informatics' early days, ways to perform calculations still needed to be discovered. Back then, it was okay to find workarounds in order to organize everything, to create new vocabulary and languages to re-use basic calculations.\nIt's now a shame to not know and use what we have. Computers and languages are so reliable that they can compute trillions of data without error, from a well made function. Besides the effects on the nanoscopic transistors, it is still reliable and we can say that the function is \"pure\".\nWho is good with functions and knows all their dirty little secrets? The mathematicians of course.\nJust use that power! CPU engineers have done their work. Now, let's show them what we can do on our side. Not to mention that new problems in the informatics field are about asynchronicity, multithreading, and concurrency - the main purpose of FP, its reason for being.\nSo what will I teach now?\nDo not change the language or framework, instead change your mind.\nContinue with docker, linters, DDD, TDD, anything that helps you to deliver reliable apps.\nBut, in your everyday work:\n\nStop writing more code, more data structures, APIs and classes. Write less until you get a core one-line, one-argument reusable pure function. Go to the smallest bits.\nTry to use these functions like a professional, and keep real world \"effects\" for before and after the beautiful process you wrote.\nBegin to learn, step-by-step, about Functional Programming. See it as a mathematical prerequisite to become a confident senior programmer.\nBegin to use functions from the FP world, just to see where they lead you (map, filter, reduce, pipe, etc.).\nBegin to write your own higher-order functions. Then benefit from their useful mathematical properties.\n\nDo you want a design pattern to begin with?\nHere is an \"onion\" pattern (aka stratified design for any size of project:\n\nYour programming language is an implicit layer with primitives that you have to thoroughly learn.\nCode a layer for core functions which are lacking in your language such as \"log\", \"not\", \"even\", \"odd\", \"concat\", \"map\", \"reduce\", \"filter\", \"compose\", \"pipe\", and so on. Or you can use an existing one, like Ramda or Lodash, but if so, learn it well. Let's call them utils.\nA layer for your \"domain\" functions and data models that you can reuse in every project in your domain, company or business. Let's call them helpers.\nA layer for your current program functions and data models. Let's call them services.\nA top layer, which is your program and where you use data, functions, and effects under control. Ideally, this is the only place where you intricate your codebase with some front end framework. Therefore, you can keep all the rest if you change your framework.\n\nEach layer is simply a composition of previous ones. If you respect this order then you can drop the upper layer at any time and use the previous one.\nFor a little project or POC, just use two or three layers.\nA new generation of coders is coming. Millions of people around the world are currently learning and training; amplified by the 'suction effect' of well paid and interesting jobs.\nThe majority think that being a problem solver or 'learning what public static void method is' or 'getting started with a trendy framework', is sufficient to create working apps. This is the case if you only need disposable programs.\nYou can spend an entire career with those illusions, finding comfort around others with the same belief system, as I had. As a consequence, the problems with everyday production updates for unfinished and unfinishable products will increase, just like JavaScript fatigue itself.\nBut there is hope too. A lot of young coders are not formatted by the OO classic journey, or imperative approach. They don't want to just solve problems with spaghetti code. Some are already fascinated with functional programming.\nSo, jump on the FP train before it's too late. The internet is in primitive chaos but we will remodel it together. It will make a difference for the future, and you will become the colleague, mentor or teacher we so desperately need.\nBut, be kind to the people who don't already know the good news, we don't want to leave them behind. Revelation could take time.\nI want to make a hypothesis, to better explain my own journey.\nWhy did JavaScript become so popular so quickly? Why do some coders fall in love with it, despite its obvious defects? I think it's only because of its function as values, that it seduced every coder that used it.\nThey don't know why it feels so good, but they stay there, naturally becoming eloquent, asking for more. Maybe this intuition will lead you to FP, just like me. Don't wait years to open your eyes, begin today.\nBut be careful, if JavaScript seduced you for this reason and you never learned how to manage it, ultimately you will end up with a defective code.\nWhat about me? Since I started using this paradigm, my programs are not only better, but more real, under control, and finally truly reliable. My codebase reduces everyday. I have never felt happier in my programmer/teacher life, because I finally know what I'm doing.\nRefactoring is now a pleasure. It feels like a game where I say: \"Oh! I can factorize that in this way and it was just a combination of simple things I already know!\"\nI still have everything to learn from math, because I avoided it for all those years.\nBut now, my impostor syndrome begins to vanish. I will never fully get rid of it, since I still believe in Shoshin (beginners mind - Zen Buddhism), but it doesn't scare me anymore.\nPS: If you want to dive into front end FP, in place of just starting incrementally in your language, you can try to learn PureScript, ClojureScript, ReasonReact, fp-ts or Elm (my personal favorite). They target JavaScript, but force you to think as a functional programmer.\n","id":"https://loic.truchot.dev/blog/cure-impostor-syndrome-with-functional-programming/","title":"Cure Impostor Syndrome with Functional Programming"},"https://loic.truchot.dev/blog/one-day-with-racket/":{"body":"\n7:56 AM - What brought me here? I'm a JavaScript Senior, and it's often mentioned that JS was inspired by Scheme.\nScheme is a dialect of LISP (an old family of languages), where everything is a workable list, looking like (function-name, arg1, arg2, arg3...).\nIt is very promising for A.I., and allows you to easily define Domain Specific Languages (DSL) with your own keywords and identifiers.\nScheme is a classic academic LISP from MIT, and Racket is a scholar's attempt at making LISP even more universally accessible (Logo is another well-known dialect).\nSo, let's do some Racket at least one day in our developer life!\n\nFind Basic Documentation\nThere are thousands of programming languages available, and plenty of websites for each of them. We can often find the official documentation for a particular one by just typing: &lt;language&gt;-lang.org: rust-lang.org, elm-lang.org, etc.\nUpon arriving at https://racket-lang.org, I'm happy to discover a clean and modern website with lively content. Before diving into in-depth documentation, I hope to find a clear introduction of the language.\nAfter a few clicks, I reach\nQuick Introduction to Racket with Pictures.\nQuick Introduction\nIt seems I have to install Racket/DrRacket installer (~175Mb) to be able to run the examples. A very simple and smooth process on Windows 10. Let's open it now.\nIt's a clean IDE interface with a menu, an empty document (named \"definitions area\") and a REPL (\"interactions area\") with some hints displayed.\nThe introduction continues, however the documentation missed a small step: before copying and pasting the samples provided, I had to choose \"racket lang\" in the \"languages\" menu. Then I had to paste #lang slideshow in the def area, and press the \"run\" button.\n\nMy first lines of code will take place in the REPL part.\nWriting (circle 10) and pressing [Enter] draws a 10px circle in the same area.\nGuess what the following commands will do?\n(circle 10)\n(circle 50)\n(rectangle 100 20)\n(arrow 20 10)\n\nIt draws shapes (and makes coffee)!\nSo I can also guess that:\n\n#lang slideshow contains useful functions to display certain shapes\ncircle, rectangle, arrow are function names\nI can execute these functions by putting them in parentheses, passing arguments separated by spaces.\nthe REPL is enough to directly interpret these inputs, then ouput the result.\n\n\nI play around without checking the docs, and ultimately make deliberate errors to see how useful the interpreter is.\n(triangle 30)\n(rectangle 10)\nrectangle 10\n\n\nErrors concerning undefined identifier seem easy to catch.\nErrors linked to arguments are a little more frightening: the technical word \"arity\" refers to the expected number of arguments of a function.\nMissing parentheses did not give me an error, just an unexpected result that I suspect to mean \"this function as a value\" (not executed).\n\nBy diving deeper, I discover that I can add several shapes on the same line...\n(hc-append\n    (rectangle 20 20)\n    (circle 20)\n)\n\nI'm assuming hc-append means \"horizontal-centered append\", but something already seems inevitable: any function name will be important, as they are so curial here.\n\n...and so it begins!\nThe famous LISP parentheses festival that shows the order of execution of functions has begun.\nDespite its reputation, I feel like it's clean and natural at the moment. The language itself seems to contain very few symbols, and mostly for simple instructions.\nCreate my own stuff\nUntil now, I used some premade functions.\nBut how do I make my own?\nThe quick-start guide tells me how to do it with the define identifier:\n(define c10 (circle 10))\nc10\n(hc-append c10 c10 c10 c10)\n\n\ndefine acts as a function that takes 2 arguments: a variable name, and a value. Now c10 is available as a classic variable.\n\n9:18 AM - It feels astonishingly simple to manipulate graphics, so I decide to write a snake-game in Racket before the sun goes down. After all, I've got the whole day...\n\nI can define a lot of stuff very easily:\n(define eye (circle 10))\n(define nose (rectangle 10 20))\n(ht-append eye nose eye)\n(define face (ht-append eye nose eye))\nface\nface\n\nBut I reach the point where the code loses some visiblity, so I'll start using the \"def area\" to define instructions, and keep the REPL to execute them...\n\nIt's clearer now, and I get a program I can save on my disk: quick-start.rkt.\nThis is not the usual approach of programming, of course. I'm used to a \"soup\" where everything is mixed.\nHere, definitions stay \"pure\", and the process of creating the program is REPL-oriented, playing with code until it works.\nA few remarks:\n\nht-append can take any number of arguments. If the first argument is a number, it represents the white-space between picts. It reminds me of the overloading practice in OOP.\nvc-append stands for vertical-centered, and so on with hb-append (horizontal-bottom), vt-append (vertical-top)...\nwhen the mouse hovers a defined name, DrRacket shows an arrow to find its definition - I discovered that by accident, and it's amazing!\nthere is no fatality about parentheses hell, as long as I define names smartly along the way.\nRacket already feels like a DSL maker. I can imagine a function that creates a triangle, another to make a square, another to combine them and make a little house, and a house function just to wrap all of this... It reminds me of the SHRDLU initiative in A.I.\n\nWhat about defining my own function? i.e. there is no square function in this package, so let's create one.\nNothing too new:\n(define (square n)\n  (rectangle n n))\n\nIn place of taking a variable name, define takes a function name and some arguments surrounded by parentheses.\nThen, a second pair of parentheses contains the actual code to run on execution.\nAnd here is my little 30px square:\n\nMy first challenge\n\n10:10 AM - I just decided to challenge myself. Can I create a function able to draw coloured cars?\n\nI don't want to only stick to the tutorial. If I found circle and hc-append in the documentation, I'm pretty sure I will find the other shapes available, and all the ways to combine them.\nHere we go, unsurprisingly:\n\nAll I need is a kind of disk for the wheel, and it exists. Now, how would I put a white disk in a slightly bigger black disk?\nIt appears there is a colorize function that takes any \"pict\" (our shape) and x11 color as a 2d argument.\n(disk 30) ; a disk, black by default\n(colorize (disk 25) \"lightgray\") ; a gray disk\n\nI can even put them together with the cc-superimpose function, a way to superimpose on center - center!\n(define black-disk\n    (disk 30))\n(define gray-disk\n    (colorize\n        (disk 25)\n        \"white\"))\n(cc-superimpose black-disk gray-disk)\n\nSo my final definitions could be:\n(define tire\n    (disk 30))\n(define hubcap\n    (colorize (disk 25) \"white\"))\n(define wheel\n    (cc-superimpose tire hubcap))\n(define wheels\n    (hc-append 100 wheel wheel))\n(define (car color)\n    (define body\n        (colorize\n            (filled-rectangle 180 20)\n            color))\n    (vc-append body wheels))\n\nAnd let's try it:\n\nOMG, so easy. What is this strange feeling? Am I a wizard or something? It works so well, and it was just some instinct and a little RTFM work. Thank you DrRacket!\nAs you can see, I tried to define a function in a function for the body of my car. I was not sure it would work, but it did!\nGoing further in the documentation, it appears that's the job of the let/let* identifier too (the * authorizes several let to use each other).\n#lang slideshow\n(define wheel\n  (let([tire (disk 30)]\n       [hubcap\n        (colorize (disk 25) \"white\")])\n    (cc-superimpose tire hubcap)))\n(define wheels\n  (hc-append 100 wheel wheel))\n(define (car color)\n  (let* ([1st-part\n          (filled-rectangle 90 20)]\n         [2nd-part\n          (filled-rectangle 180 20)]\n         [compartment\n          (colorize 1st-part color)]\n         [body (colorize\n                2nd-part color)])\n    (vc-append compartment body wheels)))\n\nThis little recfactoring limits the scope of my definitions, and that's always good practice. I can go further, and put everything in the car definition.\n\nFirst citizen\nOne of the big strenghts of JavaScript is the \"function as value\", which implies that a function can take another one as an argument (also known as higher-order functions).\nfunction example(callback) {\n  console.log(\"hello\");\n  callback();\n}\nexample(() =&gt; console.log(\"world!\"));\n\nAnd of course you can put functions in variables, or even make a function that returns another one (aka currying, thanks EcmaGod for the arrow function).\nconst car = (size) =&gt; (color) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`It's a ${size} ${color} car!`);\n};\nconst bigCar = car(\"big\");\nconst smallCar = car(\"small\");\nbigCar(\"blue\");\nbigCar(\"red\");\nsmallCar(\"violet\");\n\nThis is the heritage of LISP, so in Racket we can also pass a function to another as an argument, and so on. Functions are values like the others (aka first-class citizen function)\nOk, but in which case will this happen?\n\n10:51 AM - I have an idea of a good use case. I want to be able to ask the program a specific number of colored cars or houses. I suspect it will request using \"functions as value\".\n\nLet's make a house first. I had to dive in the documentation to find rotate, inset, pi, sqrt, without any surprise.\nBefore you read this code, be prepared: in LISP, math operators are functions, defined and working like any other.\nSo:\n(+ 1 2) ; returns 3\n(* 4 3) ; returns 12\n(/ 8 2) ; returns 4\n(= 5 5) ; returns true (#t) since it checks number equality\n; and so on.\n\nIn other words, no more \"infix\" operators (symbol in between the 2 operands): an addition is no more than a simple function and its signature is (number, number) -&gt; number.\n(define (house color)\n  (let* ([size 30]\n         ; diagonal to assemble well sized home and roof\n         [diag (* (sqrt 2) size)]\n         ; base rectangles for roof, home, door\n         [rect1 (filled-rectangle 30 30)]\n         [rect2 (filled-rectangle diag diag)]\n         [rect3 (filled-rectangle 10 20)]\n         ; roof is a rotated/clipped square\n         ; (in other word, a triangle)\n         [roof (let* ([colored (colorize rect1 color)]\n                      [rotated (rotate colored (/ pi 4))])\n                 (inset rotated 0 0 0 -20))]\n         [home (colorize rect2 color)]\n         ; structure is just a roof on a home\n         [structure  (vc-append roof home)]\n         [door (colorize rect3 \"gray\")])\n    ;let's add a door on center-bottom\n    (cb-superimpose structure door)))\n\nThis is improvisation, but it works! Even if this piece of code appears complex, I swear it was easy to write! And now, let's just use (house \"color\") everywhere...\n\nNow let's write this very special function. I just want to say \"draw 3 blue houses\" and get them. The signature would look like (n, color, thing) -&gt; pict.\n; dumb color identifiers\n(define blue \"blue\")\n(define red \"red\")\n; draw function\n(define (draw n color thing)\n    (hc-append (thing color)))\n(draw 1 blue house)\n(draw 1 red car)\n\nIt works, and I can see here that thing is a \"function as value\", where draw is an \"higher order function\": a function in charge of executing another.\nThe next challenge is to do something with this n parameter.&nbsp;I need a \"for loop\", but guess what, it's not [idiomatic](Programming idiom) Racket!\nIndeed, Racket is not a big set of reserved imperative keywords like other languages are. On the contrary, it's a very small set of powerful identifiers (define, let...), just enough to create our own language (And indeed, some forms of \"for\" or \"while\" exist in Racket langs/libraries/modules as defined functions).\nBasic iteration will be built on top of recursion. In JavaScript, recursion looks like this:\nconst recursiveFunction = (n) =&gt; {\n  if (n &lt;= 0) {\n    console.log(\"the end!\");\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"n is now \" + n);\n    recursiveFunction(n - 1);\n  }\n};\nrecursiveFunction(10);\n\nThe loop occurs because the function calls itself until a condition is met - or \"while\" a condition is still valid (just like any loop in fact - but recursion shows that functions can be loops, and \"for\" or \"while\" are an optional tool).\nLet's try recursion in Racket. Before that, I'll need a few new tools that I easily found in the documentation:\n\nprint that writes in the console like console.log in JS\nstring-append for string concatenation\nnumber-&gt;string to cast a number as a string\n\n(define (recursive-function n)\n  (print (string-append\n          \"n is now \"\n          (number-&gt;string n))))\n\nLast but not least:\n\nif is a function like all the others, it takes 3 arguments: a \"test\" (condition), a \"then\" (consequent) and an \"else\" (alternative)\n\n(print (if\n        (= 3 3)\n        \"3 is 3\"\n        \"wtf\" ))\n\n\nbegin is a function that executes several functions one by one, and just keeps the result of the last one.\n\nOk, let's put all the pieces together:\n(define (recursive-function n)\n  (let ([msg1 \"the end!\"]\n        [msg2 (string-append\n               \"n is now \"\n               (number-&gt;string n))])\n    (if\n     (&lt;= n 0)\n     (print msg1)\n     (begin (print msg2)\n            (recursive-function (- n 1))))))\n\n(recursive-function 10)\n\n\nIf I want to append a picture to previous pictures recursively, I have to begin with some kind of \"empty\" picture.\nIndeed, a function that adds \"42\" to nothing (null / undefined) will break:&nbsp;it must at least add \"1\" to \"0\".\nThis empty-picture base-case is named blank in the library.\nAnd now, I can apply recursion to my example:\n; draw function\n(define (draw n color thing [pict (blank)])\n  (if (&gt; n 0) ; n greater than 0\n      (draw (- n 1); continue to combine picts\n            color\n            thing\n            (hc-append pict (thing color)))\n      pict)); else return the final pict\n\n\nHey, what is this unknown [pict (blank)]? It's a way to provide an optional parameter with a default value.\nIn ES6, it could be mirrored with:\nfunction draw(n, color, thing, pict = new Pict()) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n...assuming there is a Pict constructor that returns an empty pict.\nIn fact, this case is a beautiful illustration of what mathematicians call a Monoid. There's special algebra for pict where I can add them infinitely, producing a new pict, starting those operations with the blank neutral element.\nThis case is so common in Computer Science (addition with 0 as neutral, multiplication with 1 as neutral, concatenation with \"\" as neutral, etc.) that the type/class Monoid itself exists in different languages and frameworks.\nFirst Conclusions\n\n2:16 PM - Sorry, but I'm starving. It's time for lunch.\n3:15 PM - Wow. We did a lot this morning, but time flies. Let's take stock, and move on to the next idea: an animated game.\n\nRacket (and therefore LISP) appears to be incredibly simple to write. Final expressions like draw me a sheep are equally easy to read, very close to natural (human) language if definitions are done that way.\nNonetheless, sometimes it still is difficult for me to read implementation details, especially when a definition goes crazy. So I recommend to take it one step at a time, focusing on quality and modularization of ideas from the beginning.\nThe first big secret that Racket teaches me is the following: you can do more with less. It sounds like Taoism, but indeed clarity grows because the field is almost empty. There are very few building blocks, but they contain an unlimited power, by the law of combination (like so much other fields in nature).\nIf you dive in a definition, you will see other definitions that look the same. Declarativeness is always preserved (and I advocate for that in all languages, so I'm thrilled).\nImperativeness can always be avoided, it's not idiomatic here. And because everything is finally a simple list of stuff that begins with an identifier, you can understand the whole language mechanics in a few hours.\nWether or not an identifier exists is not the real question:&nbsp;you take as little (or an enormous backed-in DSL) as you wish.\n\n(define x y)\n(define (x y) z)\n(+ 1 2)\n(if x y z)\n(list \"blue\" \"red\" \"green\")\n(map (lambda (x) (* x x)) a-list)\nand so on\n\nI know that LISP stands for LISt Processor and I understand why. I clearly get why it's a good language to learn the basics of CS, and even why Uncle Bob himself says that maybe in the future, a lot of disparate languages will converge on some kind of LISP.\nIf one day hardware capacity is no more a limitation, it indeed can become the only language to produce any DSL you want, that every developer could understand around the world without struggling with new weird language mechanics, while focusing on a syntax and algebra that perfectly describe a domain...\nBack To Work\nNow, 2 new crazy challenges:\n\nWhat about asking for \"4 big blue houses\"?\nHow to make stuff move in time?\n\nScaling\nBack to the docs! I discover that Racket is strongly typed.\nWTF? I didn't write any type since the beginning!\nIndeed, it's dynamically typed, but it's not weakly typed: those are 2 different concepts.\nIn JavaScript \"number\" is a weak type, for all kinds of numbers.\nIn racket, a number has a stonger type, like \"integer\"... but still is automatically assigned (like in JS).\nOne very smart thing about the pict-lib provided by #lang/slideshow, is that almost all functions take a pict typed value and return a pict as well. That's why I can combine them, and reuse them. More generally, that's how you make a good DSL, and not only a framework/library.\nSo this should work perfectly:\n(scale (house \"orangered\") 2)\n(scale (rotate\n        (car \"powderblue\")\n        (/ pi 5))\n       0.5)\n\n\nNow I'll enhance my legacy code. If I want to be able to ask for a big, small or normal-sized house I'll need some kind of switch or else if statement.\nThat switch can be done using case whereas else-if is more like cond\n(define\n  (draw n size color thing [pict (blank)])\n  (if\n   (&gt; n 0) ; condition\n   ; if true\n   (let*\n       ([scale-size\n         (case size\n           [(\"small\") 0.5]\n           [(\"big\") 2]\n           [else 1]\n           )]\n        [next-pict (hc-append\n                    pict\n                    (scale\n                     (thing color)\n                     scale-size))])\n     (draw (- n 1) size color thing next-pict))\n   ; if false\n   pict))\n\n\nMoving\nThe future snake will be moving in a 2d plane.\nIs it even possible with my current lang/slideshow? There is indeed an animation documentation, but it appears to be highly related to slideshow stuff.\nAnd it's not only about moving: I'll need a window, a game loop, collision stuff and so on.\nLet's take some time to choose a better lang than slideshow for this advanced visual stuff...\n\nIt's already 4:45 PM - Will I get a chance to get something running before midnight? Differents tools appear to make games, dependant on new stuff.\nA bit like this racket/gui, but it will force me to learn a new way to draw: the draw-lib...\nI continue but searching takes time. I even find a fully working snake game, but the code is too avanced for me...\n\n\n5:09 PM - In the end, my choice falls on the r-cade packages - it seems to contain everything I need, and claims to have a snake-game example (that I will avoid for now, but will compare with in the end)\n\nA Snake Game\nR-cade Setup\nLet's try the simplest example game:\n#lang racket\n(require r-cade)\n\n; main function, called once per frame\n(define (game-loop)\n  (cls) ; clear view each frame\n  (text 2 2 (frame))) ; print view each frame, with the frame number as text\n\n; 128px window runing a loop at 60frame/s speed\n(run game-loop 128 128)\n\nOh no! r-cade is not know by DrRacket. Thankfully the error provides me with a link to install it... which works directly.\nOh no! r-cade needs some dependencies on windows to run!\nIt's well documented here. I therefore install csfml (I unzip it in a freshly made C:\\other_program\\csfml folder to be sure not to pollute my computer), and add the path to the Windows Path environment variable.\n\nI had to install OpenAL as well, then fully restart DrRacket to be able to run my sample.\n\nSnake Specifications\nWhat is a Snake Game? Here is my very opinionated vision of a simplified version:\n\n\na 20x20 grid, made of tiles that have x/y coordinates\n\n\na tile can be:\n\na wall tile (all edges)\nan apple tile\na part of the snake: a snake-tile\na blank-tile\n\n\n\nthe snake:\n\nis made of 1+ consecutive snake-tiles\nis always moving in the previously set direction (every 500ms)\nthe head can take any cardinal direction (NESW)\nthe body follows the head\nwhen the head collides an apple-tile:\n\nthe apple disapears\nthe snake grows by 1&nbsp;snake-tile\n\n\nwhen the head collides a wall-tile or snake-tile: Game Over.\n\n\n\napples:\n\nthere is always one in a random position in the field\nif it's eaten, it disappears and a new one pops on a ramdom empty tile\nif there is no empty tile left: Game Over\n\n\n\nImplementation\nWindow And Walls\nLet's try to make a 20x20&nbsp;window with 4 walls.\nSadly, I know nothing about videogame development.\nMy first reflex is just to draw walls as such:\n#lang racket\n(require r-cade)\n(define (game-loop)\n  (cls)\n  (begin\n    (color 4)\n    (rect 0 0 20 1 #:fill #t)))\n    ; and so on for all stuff to draw\n  (run game-loop grid-size grid-size)\n\nThis will draw on top-left a 1x20 sized rectangle, filled with a brown color.\n\nDo you remember about begin, allowing a series of functions?\nI execute first the function color to pick a color in a 16 colors palette (4 = brown) for the next steps.\nrect takes x y coordinates, h w sizes, and this strange #:fill #t. It's a \"fill\" unordered named argument (how smart!) that takes the value True or False: #t or #f in Racket.\nI then continue with other walls, apples and a snake. But this method is a dead end because it doesn't track anything. It just produces a picture without state, without life.\nWhat I really want is a representation of the state of the game, that can change and be re-drawn. A grid with the state of all its tiles.\nI opt for a grid that is a list of lists: (rows) containing tiles (cells). A tile will be a tuple (a list with a few ordered members): (coord-x coord-y tile-type), like (12 3 \"apple\").\nEach game frame of the main loop will draw this grid, finding the current state of each tile.\n;; grid values\n(define grid-size 20)\n(define grid\n  (build-list\n   grid-size\n   (lambda (y)\n     (build-list grid-size (lambda (x) (list x y \"blank\"))))))\n\nHere build-list n value-as-lambda creates a list of n items with cohesive values. Thoses values are based on a lambda: an anonymous and temporary function to call for the creation of the value. The lambda takes the current index as argument. In fact, I operate in nested lists to obtain this full grid of (x y tile-type) tuples.\nNow, my wall's definition:\n; wall definition\n(define max-grid-index (- grid-size 1))\n(define wall-coords\n  (let ([top (build-list grid-size (lambda (x)(list x 0)))]\n        [bottom (build-list grid-size (lambda (x)(list x max-grid-index)))]\n        [left (build-list (- grid-size 2) (lambda (y)(list 0 (+ y 1))))]\n        [right (build-list (- grid-size 2) (lambda (y)(list max-grid-index (+ y 1))))]\n\n        )\n    (append top bottom left right)))\n\nNothing new here except for this append used to concatenate lists.\nBut where is the glue? How do I update the grid ?\nIn functional programming in general, you avoid state, mutability and side effects. But my approach of this game implies a changing state:&nbsp;the grid.\n(set! var-name new-value) is the way to proceed. for-each, list-update, list-set are identifiers coming from list docs.\n; -- update 1 tile in grid\n(define (update-tile coord val)\n  (let* ([row-idx (list-ref coord 1)]\n         [cell-idx (list-ref coord 0)]\n         [row (list-ref grid row-idx )]\n         [tile (list-ref row cell-idx)]\n         [updated (list-set tile 2 val)])\n    (set!\n     grid (list-set grid row-idx\n                    (list-set row cell-idx updated)))))\n\n; -- update a list of tiles\n(define (update-tiles coords val)\n  (for-each\n   (lambda (coord)(update-tile coord val))\n   coords))\n\nWhat I need now is a function to draw that on the window:\n; draw definitions\n(define (color-code tile-type)\n  (case tile-type\n    [(\"wall\") 4]\n    [(\"snake\") 11]\n    [(\"apple\") 8]\n    [else 7]))\n\n; -- draw colored grid on screen with\n(define (draw-grid grid)\n  (for-each\n   (lambda (row)\n     (for-each\n      (lambda (tile)\n        (let ([type (list-ref tile 2)]\n              [x (list-ref tile 0)]\n              [y (list-ref tile 1)])\n          (begin\n            (color (color-code type)); color setted for next function\n            (rect x y 1 1 #:fill #t))))\n      row))\n   grid))\n\n; game definitions\n(define (game-loop)\n  (cls)\n  (begin\n    (draw-grid grid)))\n\n; procedure\n(update-tiles wall-coords \"wall\")\n(run game-loop grid-size grid-size)\n\nI just produced a brown rectangle (or other colors) for each related info we have in the grid.\n\n\nhmm... 8:12 PM - Let's take a final pause for dinner. I have some doubts about my ability to finish this challenge in time...\nBut I have hope acting as fuel!\nI want to brag at work tomorrow, so failing is not an option.\n\nThe Snake\nShow it\nI want a centered snake, so I change my grid size to 21. The center should be (10 10) and I calculate it (because I want to be able to change the size of my grid).\nIf I want it to move 2 times per second, I have to change the framerate too.\n(define grid-size 21)\n; ...\n; snake definitions\n(define snake-coords\n  (let ([val (round (- ( / grid-size 2) 1))])\n    (list val val)))\n\n; procedure\n(update-tiles wall-coords \"wall\")\n(update-tile snake-coords \"snake\")\n(run game-loop grid-size grid-size #:fps 2)\n\n\nMove it\nA move will happen just after each draw. What I want to do is make the head of the snake follow a direction with each re-draw, until a given event.\nFor now, it simply goes like:\n(define (snake-position-update)\n  (begin (update-tile snake-coords \"blank\")\n         (let [(new-coords (list (list-ref snake-coords 0) (- (list-ref snake-coords 1) 1)))]\n           (set! snake-coords new-coords)\n           (update-tile new-coords \"snake\"))))\n\n;...\n\n; game definitions\n(define (game-loop)\n  (cls)\n  (snake-position-update)\n  (draw-grid grid))\n\nWhat about a collision with a wall?\nI can use quit, which stops the game when it occurs.\n(define (snake-position-update)\n  (begin (update-tile snake-coords \"blank\")\n         (let* ([new-coords (list (list-ref snake-coords 0) (- (list-ref snake-coords 1) 1))]\n                [next-tile (read-tile new-coords)])\n           (if (equal? (list-ref next-tile 2) \"blank\")\n               (begin\n                 (set! snake-coords new-coords)\n                 (update-tile new-coords \"snake\"))\n               (quit)))))\nControl it\nI suspect an awesome lang like r-cade to embed everything I need to change the direction of the snake when an arrow is pressed.\n(define snake-direction \"top\")\n\n(define (move direction) (set! snake-direction direction))\n\n(define (snake-action)\n  (let ([direction (cond [(btn-up) \"up\"]\n                         [(btn-right) \"right\"]\n                         [(btn-down) \"down\"]\n                         [(btn-left) \"left\"]\n                         [else snake-direction])])\n    (move direction)))\n\nIsn't it self explanatory?\nWhen snake-action is called, check which button is currently pressed and move in the related direction.\nI just have to plug it in the loop and wait to see the effect!\n(define (game-loop)\n  (cls)\n  (snake-action)\n  (snake-position-update)\n  (draw-grid grid))\n\nI'm getting ready for the final step: making the move itself depend on this direction.\nI just have to adujst the next x and y accordingly.\n;; snake update\n(define (snake-position-update)\n  (begin\n    (update-tile snake-coords \"blank\")\n    (let*\n        ([x (list-ref snake-coords 0)]\n         [y (list-ref snake-coords 1)]\n         [new-coords\n          (case snake-direction\n            [(\"top\")(list x (- y 1))]\n            [(\"down\")(list x (+ y 1))]\n            [(\"right\")(list (+ x 1) y)]\n            [(\"left\")(list (- x 1) y)]\n            [else (list x (- y 1))])]\n\n         [next-tile (read-tile new-coords)])\n      (if (equal? (list-ref next-tile 2) \"blank\")\n          (begin\n            (set! snake-coords new-coords)\n            (update-tile new-coords \"snake\"))\n          (quit)))))\n\n\n\nAnd... it works well, despite the fact that the loop reiterates every 500ms, which is not enough to get all the inputs if I press the buttons too quickly.\n; game definitions\n(define game-speed 3)\n(define (game-loop)\n  (cls); clear screen\n  (snake-action); get user inputs\n  (when\n      (=\n       (modulo (frame) (/ 60 game-speed))\n       0)\n    (snake-position-update)); change snake position\n  (draw-grid grid))\n; procedure\n(update-tiles wall-coords \"wall\")\n(update-tile snake-coords \"snake\")\n(run game-loop grid-size grid-size #:fps 60)\n\nTo ensure every keypress event is taken, I revert the fps to 60,\nthen define a game-speed that will slow the view's update process.\nwhen is what you find when you search for \"if without else in racket\".\nThe modulo makes the update \"sleep\" every turn except during the chosen one.\n\nIt's 10:20 PM and I still haven't reached the main complexity of the snake problem.\nI can't sleep with that it mind, so I'll continue. As usual in computer science: devil is in the details, and estimation is fortune telling.\n\nApples\nThe specs I made say that there is always only one apple in the field, that could get eaten by the snake:&nbsp;in this case a new one will pop. But it has to pop on a blank tile, so I suspect I will need something like:\n;;; read 1 tile\n(define (read-tile coord)\n  (let* ([row (list-ref grid (list-ref coord 1))]\n         [tile (list-ref row (list-ref coord 0))])\n    tile))\n;;; check if a tile is blank\n(define (is-tile-blank coords)\n  (let* ([tile (read-tile coords)]\n         [type (list-ref tile 2)])\n    (equal? type \"blank\")))\n\nI will also need some randomisation here. You can imagine it exists in racket:\n; apples\n(define (draw-random-apple)\n  (let* ([x (random 1 20)]\n         [y (random 1 20)]\n         [coords (list x y)])\n    (if (is-tile-blank coords)\n        (update-tile coords \"apple\")\n        (draw-random-apple))))\n;...\n(draw-random-apple)\n(run game-loop grid-size grid-size #:fps 60)\n\n\nRecursion acts as a loop here: until the coordinates are not a blank tile, try again.\nWhen it's a blank tile, I get the result. I just need to make sure to draw one before the start. Here we go.\nCollisions\nWhen the snake meets an apple:\n\nthe apple is removed\nthe snake grows\na new apple pops\n\nThe first and second step could be a common step: replace the apple with a snake part.\nI will change the name of snake-update-position to game-update which reflects the situation better.\n(define (game-update)\n  (begin\n    (update-tile snake-coords \"blank\")\n    (let*\n        ([x (list-ref snake-coords 0)]\n         [y (list-ref snake-coords 1)]\n         [new-coords\n          (case snake-direction\n            [(\"top\")(list x (- y 1))]\n            [(\"down\")(list x (+ y 1))]\n            [(\"right\")(list (+ x 1) y)]\n            [(\"left\")(list (- x 1) y)]\n            [else (list x (- y 1))])])\n      (cond [(is-tile-blank new-coords)\n             (begin\n               (set! snake-coords new-coords)\n               (update-tile new-coords \"snake\"))]\n            [(is-tile-apple new-coords)\n             (begin\n               (set! snake-coords new-coords)\n               (update-tile new-coords \"snake\")\n               (draw-random-apple))]\n            [else (quit)]))))\n\nWorks well... until I remember that the snake should grow.\nAnd this part sounds to me like it's the real complexity: now the snake has to be a list of coordinates following each other and not just a point.\n\nLate, so late, I'm tired. I'll try, but I can't promise anything.\n\nSnake as a list:\n; snake definitions\n(define snake-coords\n  (let ([val (round (- ( / grid-size 2) 1))])\n    (list (list val val))))\n(define snake-direction \"top\")\n\nNow, let's replace all\n(update-tile snake-coords \"snake\")\n\nwith (see the extra \"s\" ?)\n(update-tiles snake-coords \"snake\")\n\nand\n(list-ref snake-coords 0)\n\nwith\n(list-ref (first snake-coords) 0)\n\nIndeed, first returns the first element of a list.\nAmazingly, it works!\nNow, the part that makes me afraid. For the snake to grow, I need to add a tail to the list just after the moment it eats an apple.\nThe snake is now a list of coordinates, following each other. When the snake moves, a new coordinate will replace the head of this list, and the tail of this list will disappear. So the re-draw will reflect this list shift.\n(cond [(is-tile-blank new-coords)\n        (begin\n          (update-tile (last snake-coords) \"blank\")\n          (set! snake-coords\n                (drop-right\n                (append (list new-coords) snake-coords) 1))\n          (update-tiles snake-coords \"snake\"))]\n      [(is-tile-apple new-coords)\n        (begin\n          (set! snake-coords\n                (append (list new-coords) snake-coords))\n          (update-tiles snake-coords \"snake\")\n          (draw-random-apple))]\n      [else (quit)])))\n\nHere I have append to update the list \"immutably\" and drop-right to do the \"remove\" job. In other words, I do some insert first/remove last, treating the snake like a linked list.\n\nThe very last shortcoming is the fact that when I press the opposite direction of the current one, the game quits.\nIndeed, the snake eats itself, because the tail of the snake is here.\nI want to prevent the user to go back, so I'll add a condition that says \"depending your current direction, you can't go back\".\nThe logic looks like:\n(define snake-direction \"up\")\n(define opposite-direction \"down\")\n(define (set-opposite-direction dir)\n  (set! opposite-direction\n        (case dir\n          [(\"up\") \"down\"]\n          [(\"right\") \"left\"]\n          [(\"down\") \"up\"]\n          [(\"left\") \"right\"])))\n\nThen in game-update, when the move is done:\n(cond [(is-tile-blank new-coords)\n        (begin\n          (update-tile (last snake-coords) \"blank\")\n          (set! snake-coords (drop-right new-snake 1))\n          (update-tiles snake-coords \"snake\")\n          (set-opposite-direction snake-direction))]\n      [(is-tile-apple new-coords)\n        (begin\n          (set! snake-coords new-snake)\n          (update-tiles snake-coords \"snake\")\n          (set-opposite-direction snake-direction)\n          (draw-random-apple))]\n      [else (quit)])))\n\nHere we go! A real snake game, made with racket, working properly!\nHappiness fills my soul and my tired body.\n\n\n00:01 AM - it was a long, but also an amazing and rewarding experience.\nRacket brings simplicity, expressiveness and well-made baked-in community DSLs on the table.\nBefore publishing this article, I'll take the time to refactor my final code.
