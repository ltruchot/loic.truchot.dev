**10 years** of marriage with JavaScript. Not easy every day of course, but I don't regret anything.

Since January 2019, I have been working as a freelance: fullstack JS half-teacher / half-senior in different companies and schools (mainly partena, itenium, lucidweb and interface3).

Before that, I had a lead-dev position at Adneom (architecture, estimates, technical validation, devops, agility, boarding and developments), and I led the JS community: training, technical watch groups, meetups, hackatons...

In a world that changes so quickly, where IT is everywhere, I hope everyone can learn Computer Science and earn a good salary by using it on interesting projects.

DeepThought does not know the ultimate question to Life, the Universe and Everything, but offers to design an even more powerful computer, Earth, to calculate it. After ten million years of calculation, the Earth is destroyed by Vogons five minutes before the computation is complete.
