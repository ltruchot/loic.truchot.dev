**10 years** of marriage with JavaScript. Not easy every day of course, but I don't regret anything.

Since January 2019, I have been working as a freelance: fullstack JS half-teacher / half-senior in different companies and schools (mainly partena, itenium, lucidweb and interface3).

Before that, I had a lead-dev position at Adneom (architecture, estimates, technical validation, devops, agility, boarding and developments), and I led the JS community: training, technical watch groups, meetups, hackatons...

In a world that changes so quickly, where IT is everywhere, I hope everyone can learn Computer Science and earn a good salary by using it on interesting projects.

This site presents my different activities in the IT field. It is primarily intended for my students as a teacher, and for employers who wish to discover my profile.
